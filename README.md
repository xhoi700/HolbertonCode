## Markdown Basics
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Below are some essential commands to get you started.

### Creating Headings
You can create headings by using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols used will determine the level of the heading.

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
```

### Bullet Points
To create bullet points, use asterisks (`*`), plus signs (`+`), or hyphens (`-`).

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub-item 1
  - Sub-item 2
```

### Images
To add an image, use the following syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text](URL_to_image)
```

Example:

```markdown
![Example Image](https://example.com/image.png)
```

### Links
To create a hyperlink, use this format:

```markdown
[Link text](URL)
```

Example:

```markdown
[Visit Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com)
```

### Code
To format inline code, wrap the text in backticks (\`):

```markdown
Here is some inline code: `print("Hello, World!")`
```

For larger code blocks, use triple backticks (\`\`\`) before and after the code:

```markdown
```
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
```
